            <h1>position: static</h1>
            <p>
                all HTML elements are statically positioned by default; 
                it is not positioned in any special way; 
                it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page
            </p>

            <h1>position: relative</h1>
            <p>
                element with relative position will be positioned relative to its normal position
            </p>

            <h1>position: fixed</h1>
            <p>
                element with fixed position will be positioned relative to the view port, which
                means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled; this doesn't leave
                a gap on the page where it'd normally have been located.

                positioned ancestor

            <div class="relative">
                <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute</div>

        <div>
            <h1>position: sticky</h1>
            <p>
                element with sticky position, is positioned based on user's scroll
                position. it toggles between position: relative and position: fixed depending on 
                scroll position. It is positioned `relative` until a given offset condition is met in the view port
                and then it sticks in that place (like position: `fixed`).
